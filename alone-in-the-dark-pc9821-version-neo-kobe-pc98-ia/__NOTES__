- Game boots up and expects to set 256-color mode by enabling EGC then writing 21h to port 6Ah, without first setting 16-color analog mode. Real hardware behavior shows that 256-color mode overrides 16-color mode and that 16-color mode is not necessary to enable 256-color mode. The scan line height (used to single-scan for 400-line and double-scan for 200-line) has no apparent effect in 256-color mode, therefore upon writing 21h the mode instantly becomes 640x400 even if the 8/16-color mode was 640x200.
