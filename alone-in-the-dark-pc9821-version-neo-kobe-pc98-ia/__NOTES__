- Game boots up and expects to set 256-color mode by enabling EGC then writing 21h to port 6Ah, without first setting 16-color analog mode. Check 16/256-color mode priority on real hardware.
- Game does not set video mode any other way. If the current graphics mode is 640x200, then theoretically the 256-color mode set will get 640x200 256-color mode. Check real hardware.
