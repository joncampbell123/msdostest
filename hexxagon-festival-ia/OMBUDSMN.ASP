                             Ombudsman Statement
           ========================================================
           "This program is published by a member of the Association
           of Shareware Professionals (ASP).  ASP wants to make sure
           that the shareware principle works for you. If you are
           unable to resolve a shareware-related problem with an ASP
           member by contacting the member directly, ASP may be able
           to help. The ASP Ombudsman can help you resolve a dispute
           or problem with an ASP member, but does not provide
           technical support for members' products. Please write to
           the ASP Ombudsman at 545 Grover Road, Muskegon, MI 49442-
           9427 or send a Compuserve message via CompuServe Mail to
           ASP Ombudsman 70007,3536"
