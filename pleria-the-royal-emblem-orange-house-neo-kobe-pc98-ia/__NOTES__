- This game assumes NEC MOUSE.COM behavior where driver init and reset show the graphics layer. Any other driver or no driver at all will result in no graphics. The HDI image loads QMOUSE which does not show graphics. The dosbox.conf uses the --pc98-graphics BOOT option to show graphics layer on startup anyway.
