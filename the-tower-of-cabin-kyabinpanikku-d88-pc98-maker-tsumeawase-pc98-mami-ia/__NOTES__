Notes:
- Game *requires* 286 emulation, or the disk image will just reboot endlessly. Does not like 386 or higher for some reason.
- Game requires you to toggle the Kana (カナ) key ON before allowing you to enter your name.
TODO:
- Game expects Kana input when entering your name. You can bypass this by hitting space repeatedly though, but it does mean DOSBox-X needs to generate Kana input in that case.
